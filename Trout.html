        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> T</span>rout also belong in the Salmonidae family, they are cousins to the Salmon and can be distinguished by the black dots spread throughout their bodies.
        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> T</span>hey can be found in both fresh and salt water, and some will grow to be up to 40+ inches with the possibility of weighing up to 40 pounds.
        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> T</span>rout can also be seen spawning during the fall, in the Milwaukee rivers along with their Salmon cousins. If you are in the area during the fall, it is definitely something worthy of checking out. </p>

    <p class="p2">
        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> O</span>ne of the most common baits to use for targeting Trout are Salmon eggs as well since they live together. - The scent of this bait is meant to mimic freshly laid Salmon eggs which attract some big trout.
        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> A</span>nother great option for targeting Trout is most types of worms (Wax worm, Corn worm, Nightcrawler worms) set on a fishing bobber to keep the worm from sinking to the lake floor.
        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> L</span>astly, any lure that can mimic a swimming minnow in appearance (inside and outside of the water) will definitely attract Trout. </p>
