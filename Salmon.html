        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> O</span>ne of the most common baits to use for targeting Salmon are Salmon eggs which are commonly placed in a sack. - The scent and coloration of this bait is meant to mimic freshly laid Salmon eggs.
        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> A</span>nother common lure used to target Salmon is a spoon lure. - These lures are great because they stand out and mimic minnows in the rough Lake Michigan waters.
        <span style = "font-size: 200%"> L</span>astly, another great option to target Salon are Spinner baits. - Similar to spoon lures, Spinner baits are flashy and create a lot of vibrations while moving through the water to attract more fish. </p>
